# Hey!
I'd ❤️ you, if you shared this theme with friends!

## About
Shows `@` sign before usernames on Discord after the update regarding removal of discriminators. Discord apparently decided that not including those is a "much better" choice...


## Info
When this theme gets updated, your modded Discord client will probably update that itself, so don't worry.

If you have any suggestions or ideas - feel free to use [Issues](https://github.com/Guliveer/AtBeforeUsername/issues)
